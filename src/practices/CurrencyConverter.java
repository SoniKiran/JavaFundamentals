/*
Problem Statement:
Write a program to convert currency value from one currency to another.
At the beginning program should show list of currencies for base currency selection from user.
On valid base currency selection program will show list to currencies again to select target currency.
If user select target currenct same as a base currency, program will print message "You have chosen same base currency and target currency and does not need conversion".
If both inputs are different, program should ask for base currency units and should print conversion value.
